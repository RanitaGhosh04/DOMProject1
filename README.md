Here is a concise overview of the Document Object Model (DOM) in points:

1.Definition: DOM stands for Document Object Model.

2.Interface: It is a programming interface that allows manipulation of HTML or XML documents.

3.Representation: Views a document as a tree of objects, where each object represents a part of the document.

4.Nodes: Nodes are the individual objects in the tree, representing elements, attributes, or text content.

5.Top-Level Object: The top-level object is called the "document" and serves as an entry point to interact with the entire document.

6.Element: A type of node that represents HTML or XML elements, like <div> or <p>.

7.Attributes: Properties of elements, such as "id" or "class," are represented as attributes.

8.Text Node: Represents the text content of an element.

9.Dynamic Manipulation: Enables dynamic modification of document content, structure, and style using programming languages like JavaScript.


-->Objective: The assignment aims to ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface (UI) across all steps of the project.
It involves using JavaScript to manipulate the style properties of a specific HTML element, which is retrieved using the getElementById method.

Steps:

1.HTML Structure:

-->Create an HTML file that includes the necessary structure.
-->Add a <div> element with a unique ID, which will be targeted in JavaScript.

-->getElementById is a method provided by the Document Object Model (DOM) interface in JavaScript. It is used to retrieve a reference to an HTML element
on a web page based on its unique identifier, known as the "id." The method allows developers to access and manipulate specific elements by selecting them using their unique ID.
